# KPI Dashboard Design

## Overview
Comprehensive patterns for designing effective Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dashboards that drive business decisions.

## 1. KPI Framework
-   **Strategic**: Long-term goals, Monthly/Quarterly updates. Audience: Executives.
-   **Tactical**: Department goals, Weekly/Monthly updates. Audience: Managers.
-   **Operational**: Day-to-day monitoring, Real-time/Daily. Audience: Teams.

### SMART KPIs
-   **S**pecific: Component/Metric defined clearly.
-   **M**easurable: Quantifiable.
-   **A**chievable: Realistic targets.
-   **R**elevant: Aligned to business goals.
-   **T**ime-bound: Defined period (MoM, YoY).

## 2. Dashboard Hierarchy Pattern
1.  **Executive Summary** (Top Layer):
    -   4-6 Headline KPIs (e.g., Revenue, user count).
    -   Trend Indicators (Up/Down arrows with % change).
    -   Critical Alerts.
2.  **Department Views** (Middle Layer):
    -   Sales, Marketing, Product specific dashboards.
3.  **Detailed Drilldowns** (Bottom Layer):
    -   Individual metric exploration, tables, and root cause analysis.

## 3. Common KPIs by Domain

### Sales
-   **Revenue**: MRR, ARR, ARPU, Growth Rate.
-   **Pipeline**: Pipeline Value, Win Rate, Deal Size, Sales Cycle.
-   **Activity**: Calls/Emails, Demos, Proposals.

### Marketing
-   **Acquisition**: CPA, CAC, Lead Volume, MQLs.
-   **Engagement**: Traffic, Conversion Rate, CTR.
-   **ROI**: Marketing ROI, Attribution, Payback Period.

### Product (SaaS)
-   **Usage**: DAU/MAU, Session Duration, Stickiness.
-   **Quality**: NPS, CSAT, Bug Count.
-   **Growth**: Retention Rate, Churn Rate (Gross/Net), Activation Rate.

### Finance
-   **Profitability**: Margins (Gross/Net), EBITDA.
-   **Liquidity**: Cash Flow, Burn Rate, Runway.

## 4. Best Practices
-   **Limit to 5-7 KPIs**: Cognitive load is real. Focus on what matters.
-   **Context is King**: Always show comparisons (vs Target, vs Last Month, vs Last Year).
-   **Consistent Color Coding**: Red = Bad, Green = Good. (Be mindful of color blindness).
-   **Vanity vs. Sanity**: Avoid "Total Registered Users" (Vanity). Use "Active Users" or "Paying Users" (Sanity).
